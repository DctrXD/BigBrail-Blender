## ⚙️ How It Works

BigBrain modifies Blender's internal undo settings via the System Preferences API.

- **Undo Steps** → Controls how many actions you can Ctrl + Z.
- **Undo Memory Limit (MB)** → Caps how much RAM undo can use. Set `0` for no limit.

> These settings persist through sessions, giving you peace of mind.

## 🧪 Future Plans

- 📦 Per-step .blend backup system
- 🖼️ Visual undo timeline with thumbnails
- 🧲 Import/export of undo sessions
- ☁️ Cloud sync for undo history (experimental)
